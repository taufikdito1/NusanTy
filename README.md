## Overview APP
Indonesia is an archipelagic country that is rich in a variety of different and unique cultures.
With this uniqueness, various cultures are created with their uniqueness. Many people don't
know about Indonesian culture, especially the next generation who can only get an
introduction to culture from the school, so gradually culture in Indonesia is starting to be
abandoned. To preserve Indonesian culture, especially in the art of traditional clothing, it is
necessary to create an application that introduces Indonesian traditional clothing through
Android-based smartphone devices.
